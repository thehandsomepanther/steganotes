The concept for homepages is broken Today we are launching a new homepage. Our trigger for this has been the fact that only a few human beings still actually read the sales slogans shown on homepages nowadays. We truly believe this concept is broken and have therefore created a humble attempt to fix this. Which concept is broken? Homepages generally get the form of an A-B-C. It starts with a section shown at the top with a clear Call To Action (CTA). As a visitor you might hit this CTA in order to see whether there’s any explanation on the next page. However, most often your attention is quickly shifted through a scroll to section B below. The B section outlines the main products and their benefits. Here’s where the yawn starts to kick in for the visitor. Section C is usually focused on social proof (what our users say), press (as featured in), or that ‘new Series A investment round’. But hey, nobody fu*king cares! For those reasons, I think it’s A-Broken-Concept. Sales people who outperform their competition ask questions, listen and then have a conversation based on your needs. Think about those phone calls from a new electricity or telecom provider. They start with a 90-second pitch while you continue with something else before you gently say “I don’t need it, good luck with your campaign” (if you’re in a good and respectful mood). A pitch like this isn’t contextual, neither is the concept of most homepages. It’s not based on the needs nor on the preferences of the visitor. In a way, they’re in line with the concept of that boring sales call. All right, it might even score a success metric of 2%. However, as competition online intensifies every day, you might want to opt for an alternative concept. OK, might be true. What’s your new concept? The conversational homepage. Why? First of all, by having a conversation with the visitor you can specifically focus on engagement with the visitor. We don’t want to let visitors scroll themselves towards boredom. We’d like to come up with a conversational interface instead that keeps visitors entertained and informs them with some catchy chat lines. Secondly, by asking a couple of simple questions we can achieve our other goal: Show content in line with the preferences and context of the visitor by optimising our homepage for every individual. If I trigger you to have a look at this conversational homepage (wait for it… first read my motivation below ;-) ) you’ll probably consider it a humble beginning for this new concept. This small start is exactly what we were aiming for. It gives us the opportunity to hear from many visitors what they like about it and what not. The conversation is relatively short. By using the quick reply buttons, the visitor can tell us their preferences such as what city or type of places they’re interested in. The conversation results in a curated city guide filled with cool places based on their preferences. We’ve also integrated some basic things to make it more fun. Such as randomised messages and a design that changes based on whether you’re visiting the site during the day or night. This relatively simple start for the concept of a conversational homepage gets us excited about all the other opportunities we’ve been thinking of for making our homepage more relevant and entertaining for all visitors. What’s next? A conversation is the perfect format to get a better understanding of your visitors. However, this is just the beginning. A good sales rep is well informed. That’s why we’ll implement more contextual information to make the conversation and, more importantly, the outcome for both parties way better. Source links for example can be valuable. Imagine a girl named Sarah, Sarah is logged in on Facebook in her browser and decides to visit Flamyngo’s homepage. We could present the option “Hi Sarah, want to check which of your friends created city guides on Flamyngo?” based on her Facebook ID. This might be a little freaky for Sarah. We could keep it simpler and more relevant to start with. As Flamyngo is about discovering cool places, we could also find out Sarah’s timezone based on her IP-address and then present places accordingly. Sarah probably just had dinner around 9pm? We’ll show a guide with cocktail bars in our conversation. Also, think about checking Sarah’s device type in order to lead her to the corresponding App Store if she’s visiting the homepage on her mobile. This isn’t rocket science. In a way it’s just a decision tree our team thought through, designed, and developed within 4 weeks next to our activities for the App, ChatBot and Widget. Is this new concept in the interest of the visitor? A better question might be “How can we prevent Sarah from yawning?”. One important factor is to turn her from a
